tirreno is an open-source fraud prevention platform.

tirreno is a universal analytic tool for monitoring online platforms, web applications, SaaS, communities, mobile applications, intranets, and e-commerce websites.

* **For Website Owners**: Protect your user areas from account takeovers, malicious bots, and common web vulnerabilities caused by user behavior.
* **For Online Communities**: Combat spam, prevent fake registrations, and stop re-registration from the same IP addresses.
* **For Startups, SaaS, and E-commerce**: Get a ready-made boilerplate for client security, including monitoring customer activity for suspicious behavior and preventing fraud using advanced email, IP address, and phone reputation checks.
* **For Platforms**: Conduct thorough merchant risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential threats from high-risk merchants, ensuring the integrity of your platform.

tirreno is a "low-tech" PHP and PostgreSQL software application that can be downloaded and installed on your own web server. After a straightforward five-minute installation process, you can immediately access real-time analytics.

## Quickstart install

1. [Download](https://www.tirreno.com/download.php) the latest version of tirreno (ZIP file).
2. Extract the tirreno-master.zip file to the location where you want it installed on your web server.
3. Navigate to `http://your-domain.example/install/index.php` in a browser to launch the installation process.
4. After the successful installation, delete the `install/` directory and its contents.
5. Navigate to `http://your-domain.example/signup/` in a browser to create administrator account.
6. For cron jobs setup insert the following schedule (every 10 minutes) expression with `crontab -e` command or by editing `/var/spool/cron/your-web-server` file:
```
*/10 * * * * cd /path/to/tirreno && /usr/bin/php /path/to/tirreno/index.php /cron >> /path/to/tirreno/logs/error.log 2>&1
```

## Docker setup (optional)

To run tirreno within docker container you may use `tirreno/tirreno:latest` image published on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tirreno/tirreno).

## Documentation

See the [User Guide](https://docs.tirreno.com/) for details on how to use tirreno.

## Optional non-free capabilities

The open-sourced tirreno code is intended to be used for free as a standalone application. It provides general statistics and an extended audit log of user requests to a monitored system. As is, this tooling may be sufficient for bringing insights about user activity and behavioral patterns in a wide range of use cases, especially as a solution for small and medium-sized organizations.

However, if you are looking to cover more advanced usage scenarios, such as fraud prevention, the additional tirreno API enrichment capabilities can be enabled via [monthly-paid subscription](https://www.tirreno.com/pricing/). Depending on the subscription plan, it supplies extended information on any of the following: IP address, email address, domain, and phone number. Enabling all the data enrichment types augments tirreno into a fully-fledged enterprise solution for an online fraud prevention system.

## Background

The business behind this platform is tirreno technologies sàrl, operated in Vaud (Switzerland). It is a privately owned, for-profit company with no venture capital involved. The tirreno project started as a proprietary system in 2021 and was open-sourced (AGPL) in December 2024.

The idea for tirreno arose from a challenge: an online platform was in need of a fraud prevention tool. We were looking for a product that could work on-premises and would not share user data with third-party vendors. Since the available solutions did not meet all our requirements, we created our own tool.

While building tirreno, we concentrated on **privacy**, **trust**, and true **sovereignty**. As a result, we have built tirreno in a secure and independent manner. The application does not have a long list of development dependencies, nor does it rely on heavy frameworks. This approach minimizes the potential attack surface.

### Why the name tirreno?

History suggests that the Tyrrhenian people may have lived in Tuscany and eastern Switzerland as far back as 800 BC. The term "Tyrrhenian” became more commonly associated with the Etruscans, and it is from them that the Tyrrhenian Sea derives its name — a name still in use today. This name is believed to be an exonym, possibly meaning “tower”.

While working on the logo, we conducted our own historical study and traced mentions of 'tirreno' back to the 15th-century printed edition of the Vulgate (the Latin Bible). We kept it lowercase to stay true to the original — quite literally, by the book.

The tirreno wordmark, positioned beyond a horizon line, as a metaphor for the constant evolution of the fraud landscape and our commitment to staying ahead of change.
